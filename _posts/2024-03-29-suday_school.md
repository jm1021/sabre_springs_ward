## Preparation
There are many patterns for preparation.   Each of us must establish a pattern that allow the Holy Ghost to direct our thoughts.  In my personal experience, I look for the moment that the spirit directs me in my preparation and try to stay in that spiritual enlightenment.  As an example, when recently reading the Verses of Isaiah, the spirit directed me when my focus centered on the "Holy One of Israel", "The Messiah", and Nephi's declaration that "We preach of Christ".

### Teaching Mantra
As I strive to impart the teachings of the Savior in today's context, aimed at Latter-Day Saints of 2024 and beyond, I've adopted a mantra: 'become a blogger.' This approach ensures that my lesson materials are readily accessible to students, and conveniently accessed on their phones for easy reference.

Blogger. A person who regularly writes material for a blog.  As Teachers, we do a lot of preparation.  The idea of blogging is to help our students, in our Sunday School "Come Follow Me" settings to have access to our ideas.

Blog follower.  A follower refers to a person who has subscribed to receive updates from a specific user, aka a teacher, using a blogging platform.  The pattern of Blogging following Blogs and commenting on blogs enables us to share the "Come Follow Me" messages in greater depth.

GitHub Pages. This Teacher uses GitHub Pages, markdown, and managing articles.  However, I believe that this could be done in Google Docs or other "very" common tools.  We can build a community of great tools and frameworks if we share a common interest and mantra.

### Teaching Preparation Helpers
Lists are difficult to remember.  But, pondering things that you typically do in preparation can often be expressed in this manner.   Here are a few things that I do to prepare for my Sunday School or Priesthood lessons.

1. Google "Provide a QR code to my website".  This allows me to put by lesson the audience’s devices.  Placing this on my phone allows exchange electronically.  I have observed in Church and my school teaching that this puts the student in the comfortable position of having the materials that will guide the lesson.
2. In my preparation, I strive to follow the "Come Follow Me" schedule daily.  I pay attention to my favorites, but I don't use this time as preparation.   I simply use this time to obtain inspiration by simply following the readings that everyone else is following. 
3. From my "Come Follow Me" interests, I typically start a blog.  My blog is not done in one sitting, but it definitely become more detailed and fervent as the teaching deadline approaches.   
4. Watch BYU channel “Come Follow Up”, this often helps me get out of my writer's block.  IMO, this type of activity is to help us gain perspective from others, not to share their material.  Often, I try to personalize their experience or messages to something that resonates with my personal experiences.
5. Use ChatGPT for reviewer/editor, it can also be a great research assistant.  I make a lot of grammatical mistakes, and ChatGPT is a great assistant.  When using ChatGPT as a personal assistant I try to ensure that I consider responses according to the culture and beliefs of our people, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
6. Live your life, remembering everything in your life, is part of your lesson.  The Savior taught many lessons using parables and familiarity to the people of his time.   I have used gardening, plumbing, basketball, generative AI, career, and my High School teaching.  Additionally, I have used the wisdom I have gained in my workplace.
7. Record your notes on verses in the online Scriptures. I have been doing this since 2012 and have been reliving that previous session with the scriptures.  Things that I record are mostly spiritual, reliving that spirit has enabled me to recapture the times that I have been touched by the Spirit.

### Teaching Day
Do not follow your blog when you Teach.  I believe it is my duty, as a Teacher, to the topic(s).   But equally, it is my duty as a Teacher to simply be a facilitator of discussion.

After the introduction, it is vitally important that you listen to each comment, and affirm and personalize the comment to your understanding.  I believe that "Teaching the Savior's Way" requires us to recognize each of his children.  My joy, when I go home from a lesson, is mostly around the great comments of the students in the class.

It is difficult, sometimes, to retain a balance of "Come Follow Me" and focusing on the Savior as some comments can lead to a tangential path.  At times, the Teacher must cut off some topics and steer back to some key ideas in the lesson.  But, don't do that out of personal interests, do it when the spirit makes you think it is time to redirect.
