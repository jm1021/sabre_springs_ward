## Key Quarterly objectives
We want to pick up our ministering with one requested item per quarter. Both the minister and the receiving family should work together on the following these objectives.

- 1st Quarter Emergency Contact.  As an emergency exercise, we want to make sure our families have the correct contact information.  If we find any issues we want to report those to our ward clerk or priesthood leader for correction.

- 2nd Quarter Visit Home or Cookies.  As an ice breaker... according to the comfort level of ministering companionship, we want to share a personal encounter with our ministering family(s).  Stop by the home, drop off cookies, meet, etc.  

- 3rd Quarter Emergency Contact.  The second emergency contact, try to talk about each other's emergency strategies.  Ministering companionship and the ministering family should exchange ideas and concerns.

- 4th Quarter Secret Santa.  Think of something to share with your family during the Christmas Season.  Establish this as a Light the World tradition, following the love that you have for the Savior.
