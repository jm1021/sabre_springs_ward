## Key Quarterly objectives
Our goal is to enhance our ministering efforts by focusing on specific tasks each quarter. Both the ministers and the families they are assigned to should collaborate on achieving these objectives.

### 1st Quarter: Emergency Contact (Due by Saturday 9 am to 11 am, March 23rd)
Contact your families between now and Saturday morning, the preferred methods of contact are in the following order:

1. Personal contact
2. Call/Text
3. Social Media (i.e. Facebook, Twitter)
4. Email (Not considered timely as email may not be checked frequently)

Contact your EQ supervisor when your contacts are attempted and the family verifies receipt.  EQ presidency is responsible for reporting every half hour between 9 am and 11 am on Saturday.  

As a key service in every preparedness exercise, ensure that our families have accurate emergency contact information. Verify numbers and addresses in the Sabre Springs Ward directory in the LDS Tools application.  Any discrepancies should be reported to our ward clerk or priesthood leader for correction.

### 2nd Quarter: Home Visit or Cookies
To build rapport, ministers share personal contact with their assigned families based on their comfort level. This could involve dropping off cookies, making a visit to their home, or engaging in other friendly interactions.

### 3rd Quarter: Emergency Contact Review
Revisit emergency contact information and discuss each other's emergency preparedness strategies. This provides an opportunity for ministers and families to exchange ideas and address any concerns in the event of a real emergency.

### 4th Quarter: Secret Santa
Encourage sharing something meaningful with your family during the Christmas season, fostering a tradition aligned with the spirit of Light the World and the love for the Savior.
